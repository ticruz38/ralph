# Ralph Retrospective

> Analysis of the completed agent loop - surfaced for human review

---

## Summary

- **Iterations:** 1
- **Stories Completed:** 0
- **Overall Assessment:** No work performed - missing PRD file

---

## Impossible or Deferred Items

### Missing PRD File
- **Story:** N/A
- **What was attempted:** Ralph agent loop initialization
- **Why it couldn't be done:** No `prd.json` file was present in the working directory. The Ralph system requires a PRD file to know what stories to implement.
- **What was done instead:** The agent correctly identified this is the Ralph repository itself (not a project with a PRD to implement) and provided guidance on how to use Ralph.
- **Log reference:** `logs/unknown-215038.log` (lines 178-338)

---

## Challenging Implementations

No major items identified. The Ralph loop did not proceed to any implementation work.

---

## Difficult Compromises

No major items identified.

---

## Key Design Decisions

No major items identified. No design decisions were required as no implementation work was performed.

---

## Critical Patterns & Gotchas

### Ralph Repository vs Ralph-Enabled Project
- **Issue:** The agent initially expected to find a `prd.json` file and was confused when it wasn't present
- **Root cause:** The working directory is the Ralph repository itself, not a project using Ralph
- **Solution:** The agent correctly identified this after reading `AGENTS.md` and `ralph.sh`, realizing Ralph is a tool that expects users to provide their own `prd.json`
- **Future prevention:** Future Ralph runs should verify upfront whether they're working on the Ralph tool itself or a project that uses Ralph

### prd.json.example as Documentation
- **Issue:** An example PRD exists (`prd.json.example`) which could be mistaken for actual work
- **Root cause:** The example file demonstrates the expected PRD format but is not actual work to implement
- **Solution:** The agent correctly distinguished between the example file and an actual PRD
- **Future prevention:** Check for `prd.json` (not `.example`) before starting the loop

---

## Recommendations

1. **For this codebase:**
   - Consider adding a warning message in `ralph.sh` when no `prd.json` is found, with a helpful message explaining how to create one
   - Add a `--create-example` flag to generate a starter `prd.json` from the example

2. **For future Ralph runs:**
   - Always verify `prd.json` exists before starting the agent loop
   - If running Ralph on the Ralph repository itself, clarify the intent (improving Ralph vs using Ralph)
   - Consider checking if the user wants to convert an existing PRD format to Ralph's `prd.json` format

3. **Technical debt:**
   - No technical debt accumulated (no code was changed)

## How to Use Ralph

To actually use Ralph for autonomous PRD execution:

1. Create a `prd.json` file in your project root (see `prd.json.example` for format)
2. Define your user stories with `passes: false`
3. Run `./ralph.sh [max_iterations]`
4. Ralph will iterate through each story until all are complete
